    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the Branch od science that deals with the propertes ,
      compostion, and bahavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemistry Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <span style="background-color: yellow">periodic table</span> table is
      a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represneted bu
      its chemical symbol. such as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for
      oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on thier
      properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemistry Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemistry reactions represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i
        >H<sub>2</sub></i
      >) and oxygen gas (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i
      >) to from water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i>)
    </p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>


    <h4>Important Concepts </h4>

    <p><var>Staichiometry</var> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. Its involves balancing equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved. </p>
    <p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a module , while <sup>superscripts</sup> represents charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the compostion of the air we breathe to the reaction that power our bobies, chemistry influences every aspect of our </p>
    <p>lines.</p>
